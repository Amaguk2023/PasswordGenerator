# Password Generator

Python program that generates secure passwords. 

The user has the option to select the length of the password, amount of passwords, choose between numbers/letters passwords or number/letters/punctuation characters passwords. 

Passwords are written inside a .txt file, file that is exported to the users' pwd. 

Libraries used: sys, secrets, strings.

*UPCOMING VERSION*

Will include a postgresql connector to store passwords and also verify that the generated passwords do not exist in the table. If the newly created passwords exist, the system will generate new ones. An encryption key will be created for secure storage. ASCII will be updated too.
