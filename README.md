# password_generator.py 

- This is my first code. Please dont hesitate to leave comments!
- v3 is bigger and with a lot of loops. Also its python 2.7.
- v4 is slimmer and cleaner. Includes more modules than v3 and python 3. 
- Made a jump from v4 to v7. Worked hard on this.
- v7 doesn't include time.sleep, 'password is being generated', random.shuffle, print(''), control flow has been changed, Recursion. Including while loops, length option, amount of passwords, password file (txt), and more.
