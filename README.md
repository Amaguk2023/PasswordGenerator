# password_generator.py
A python script which generates secure passwords with a length, amount and punctuation option. All the generated passwords are written inside a .txt file which is exported to the users' pwd.

#### Note: This is my first code. Please dont hesitate to leave comments!
### V3:
- is bigger
- a lot of loops
- Python 2.7

### V4:
- is slimmer and cleaner
- includes more modules than V3
- Python 3

### V7:
- Made a jump from V4 to V7
- doesn't include:
  - time.sleep
  - 'password is being generated'
  - random.shuffle
  - print('')
- control flow has been changed
- recursion 
- including:
  - while loops
  - length option
  - amount of passwords
